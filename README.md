# **TMJ Dysfunction Detection Project**

## **Overview**
This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on the detection of 
temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction using advanced image processing and machine learning techniques.
The project utilizes the Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO) algorithm for image augmentation and introduces 
a novel approach for feature map fusion and bounding box regression to enhance detection accuracy.

## **Features**
- Implementation of EHO-GAN for image augmentation
- Feature map fusion and bounding box regression for improved detection accuracy
- Two-stage network structure for efficient region-based classification
- Multi-task loss function incorporating classification and bounding box regression
- Belief C-Means clustering for determining feature map scales
